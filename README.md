# Simulation-of-Fast-Ethernet
This project is to simulate the Fast Ethernet. The goal of the project is to practice basic socket API programming through a client/server application. It is a simulation in the sense that the fast Ethernet is simulated by multiple processes on multiple machines. Each station in the Ethernet is simulated by a process. The switch of the fast Ethernet is also simulated by a process. Those processes can run on different workstations in the Linux lab.
